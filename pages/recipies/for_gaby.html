    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A very basic website, I know. Not the most elegant aesthetically or functionally but part of what I'll be doing here is updating this site to look and work better as I learn more. My ultimate goal with this site is to make it a functional store of all my favorite recipies, self-created and otherwise. Maybe youd like to help with those? Also, hope kiddo is ok to use, I haven't used it for anyone else, it just felt like it fit.
